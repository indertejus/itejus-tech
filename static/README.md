# https://itstk.me - source code.
you can fork this code and make your own website! note that change all links and css and all, remove all the files that you dont need. `DO IT`

# how to host?
using a host like https://railway.app (like i used) can be used to host ur website. ive already figured out everything in the `index.js` file. make sure to change the links such as `https://itstkme-production.up.railway.app` and `https://itstk.me`. ill upload a tutorial soon in yt! visit at https://itstk.me/youtube :eyes:

# what does railway-logs.bat do?
this shows the logs on ur pc when its hosted and ready. to use it you have to link the railway project to ur pc, will show in tutorial
to do it, go to setup tab, follow the instructions
link the project by `cd`ing to ur project folder.

# so what about .gitignore
.gitignore removes all files that github shouldnt commit. dont change anything there unless u want to change something else.

# where will i code my website?
`/static` folder contains all html files and other stuff, there you will code your website and deploy it on railway. dont change anything in index.js yet, this might mess up hosting. do if you know.

# conclusion and some notes
the css, js, and html files will be messed up lol as im a rough and noob coder, just do it in a way you like k!
